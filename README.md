# WORKFLOW_Mini_project_JAVA

This is a project implemented using JAVA data structures. 

1. We were supposed to validate a workflow by checking for 'cycle', 'connectivity' and 'Loop'.

2. Schedule workflow functions on one machine.

3. Schedule workflow functions on a cluster.

With our understanding of data structures thought to us we were supposed to finish this project.
We were not allowed to use pre built data structures of JAVA and implement them on our own.
Some of the data structures used are LinkedList, Graph, Map, etc.
Used algorithms such as 'Bread First Search' and 'Depth First Search' during this project. 

Solution.java is the main file and the rest are supporting files.
